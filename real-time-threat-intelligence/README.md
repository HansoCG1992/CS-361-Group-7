**Project Overview**
---

Our Members: Kyle Naluan, Logan George, Sam Burns, Cole Hanson, Bryce Bohlman

This project includes the development of a risk management framework as well as a web application for a real-time threat intelligence system for ShopSmart Solutions. 

Our group will analyze threats, vulnerabilities, and assets (TVA), conduct risk assessments, and implement risk treatment strategies for the e-commerce platform.

Our framework will align with the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) and NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.

This project will incorporate OSINT tools (Shodan, HIBP, ANY.RUN) and LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 API) for automation.

The project will follow these 5 phases:

| Phase | Title | Activities | Completion Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Project Planning and Research | Team Formation and Role Assignment, Research NIST Standards and OSINT Tools | ✅ |
| 2 | Asset, Threat, and Vulnerability Assessment | Asset Identification, Threat Enumeration, Vulnerability Analysis | ❌ |
| 3 | Risk Analysis and Real-Time Monitoring | Risk Evaluation & Prioritization, Integration of OSINT Tools for Threat Intelligence | ❌ |
| 4 | Risk Treatment and Automation | Developing Risk Treatment Strategies, Automating Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) | ❌ |
| 5 | Documentation and Presentation | Compiling Reports, Final Presentation | ❌ |

**Final Deliverables:**
