**NIST Framework Summary**

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0**

The NIST CSF 2.0 is a framework that provides guidance for businesses to organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. It provides high level security outcomes for businesses of all sizes or maturities to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts. It doesn't directly guide on how to achieve outcomes, but points to other online sources which can provide more assistance.

The NIST CSF has a CSF Core, which is a classification of cybersecurity outcomes. The CSF Core components are a hierarchy of Functions, Categories, and Subcategories that detail each outcome.

The following CSF Core Function organize cybersecurity outcomes at their highest level:
- **Govern (GV)** - The organization’s cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored. The GOVERN Function provides outcomes to inform what an organization may do to achieve and prioritize the outcomes of the other five Functions in the context of its mission and stakeholder expectations.
- **Identify (ID)** - The organization’s current cybersecurity risks are understood. Understanding the organization’s assets (e.g., data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people), suppliers, and related cybersecurity risks enables an organization to prioritize its efforts consistent with its risk management strategy and the mission needs identified under GOVERN.
- **Protect (PR)** - Safeguards to manage the organization’s cybersecurity risks are used. Once assets and risks are identified and prioritized, PROTECT supports the ability to secure those assets to prevent or lower the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity events, as well as to increase the likelihood and impact of taking advantage of opportunities. Outcomes covered by this Function include identity management, authentication, and access control; awareness and training; data security; platform security; and the resilience of technology infrastructure.
- **Detect (DE)** -  Possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises are found and analyzed. DETECT enables the timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events that may indicate that cybersecurity attacks and incidents are occurring. This Function supports successful incident response and recovery activities.
- **Respond (RS)** - Actions regarding a detected cybersecurity incident are taken. RESPOND supports the ability to contain the effects of cybersecurity incidents. Outcomes within this Function cover incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting, and communication. 
- **Recover (RC)** - Assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident are restored. RECOVER supports the timely restoration of normal operations to reduce the effects of cybersecurity incidents and enable appropriate communication during recovery efforts.  

All of these functions relate to one another and should be addressed concurrently.

NIST CSF also includes **CSF Profiles**, which describe an organization’s current and/or target cybersecurity posture in terms of the Core’s outcomes.
- **Current Profiles** specify the Core outcomes that an organization is currently achieving.
- **Target Profiles** specify the desired outcomes that an organization has selected and prioritize for achieving its cybersecurity risk management objectives.

**CSF Tiers** are used by an organization to inform its Current and Target Profiles. Tiers characterize the rigor of an organization's cybersecurity risk governance and management practices.

The NIST CSF 2.0 also includes online resources that supplement the CSF, as well as a guide to improving cybersecurity risk communication and integration.

**NIST SP 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF)**

The NIST SP 800-37 RMF provides guidelines for applying the RMF to information systems and organizations. It provides a disciplined, structured, and flexible process for managing security and privacy risk that includes information security categorization; control selection, implementation, and assessment; system and common control authorizations; and continuous monitoring.

The publication describes that managing information system-related security and privacy risk affects and requires the involvement of the entire organization. It presents a multi-level approach that addresses security and privacy risk at the organization level [1], the mission/business process level [2], and the information system level [3].

- The activities conducted at Levels 1 and 2 are critical to preparing the organization to execute the RMF.
- Preparing the organization to execute the RMF can include: 
    - Assigning roles and responsibilities for organizational risk management processes; 
    - Establishing a risk management strategy and organizational risk tolerance; 
    - Identifying the missions, business functions, and mission/business processes the information system is intended to support;
-  Level 3 addresses risk from an information system perspective and is guided and informed by the risk decisions at the organization and mission/business process levels. The risk decisions at Levels 1 and 2 can impact the selection and implementation of controls at the system level.

The publication also provides 7 steps for executing the RMF:
- **Prepare** to execute the RMF from an organization- and a system-level perspective by establishing a context and priorities for managing security and privacy risk.
- **Categorize** the system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system based on an analysis of the impact of loss.
- **Select** an initial set of controls for the system and tailor the controls as needed to reduce risk to an acceptable level based on an assessment of risk. 
- **Implement** the controls and describe how the controls are employed within the system and its environment of operation. 
- **Assess** the controls to determine if the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcomes with respect to satisfying the security and privacy requirements.  
- **Authorize** the system or common controls based on a determination that the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation is acceptable.  
- **Monitor** the system and the associated controls on an ongoing basis to include assessing control effectiveness, documenting changes to the system and environment of operation, conducting risk assessments and impact analyses, and reporting the security and privacy posture of the system.  

The steps, after the prepare step, may be completed in sequential order, but organizations do not have to do it that way. They have flexibility in how each of the RMF steps and tasks are carried out.
